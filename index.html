        <div class="desc">When we got introduced to Adobe Photoshop we were given a sheet of paper full of assignments, we were free to choose which one we went for and thats how this creation came about. I decided to make a movie poster that is a mix between Game of Thrones and Mad Men.</div>

        <div class="desc"> In our second workshop, the topic was moving art. We had been introduced to the world of animation in Adobe Animate	, and was told to pick some famous paintings that we were going to animate. I chose the painting "The Son of Man" by René Magritte as the base, then found other paintings that would help me turn one of my favourite paintings into a fun little animation.</div>
